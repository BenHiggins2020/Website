    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>
      I am an enthusiastic team player, I played Tennis through highschool and college.<br>
      This helped me learn team mechanics and managment as well as individual coaching.<br>
          I am self-motivated and enjoy working hard to improve myself and skills.<br>
      I enjoy learning new things and overcoming new challenges, I made this site for fun as I am a mechanical engineer I have no formal education in any of the development programs used here. <br>
   I am always finding new passions and challenging myself to learn and try new things, this website is an example of that! <br>
